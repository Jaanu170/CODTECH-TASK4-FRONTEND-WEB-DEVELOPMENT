In Task 4, I developed the user interface (UI) for a multi-page E-Learning Platform. This platform simulates a modern online education portal where students can browse available courses, view individual course details including videos, and track their progress visually.

The design focuses on:

User-friendly navigation

Course visibility

Interactive learning experience

Mobile responsiveness

This project demonstrates how an educational interface can be built from scratch using only HTML and CSS, with an emphasis on layout, styling, and UI consistency.
